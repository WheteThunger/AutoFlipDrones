## FAQ

#### How do I get a drone?

As of this writing, RC drones are a deployable item named `drone`, but they do not appear naturally in any loot table, nor are they craftable. However, since they are simply an item, you can use plugins to add them to loot tables, kits, GUI shops, etc. Admins can also get them with the command `inventory.give drone 1`, or spawn one in directly with `spawn drone.deployed`.

#### How do I remote-control a drone?

If a player has building privilege, they can pull out a hammer and set the ID of the drone. They can then enter that ID at a computer station and select it to start controlling the drone. Controls are `W`/`A`/`S`/`D` to move, `shift` (sprint) to go up, `ctrl` (duck) to go down, and mouse to steer.

Note: If you are unable to steer the drone, that is likely because you have a plugin drawing a UI that is grabbing the mouse cursor. For example, the Movable CCTV plugin previously caused this and was patched in March 2021.
